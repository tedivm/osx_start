osx_start
=========

This application sets up Homebrew and Cask in order to install many common binaries and applications.

Run this command from the terminal as your standard user to run the latest version of the script.

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tedivm/osx_start/master/startup.sh | bash
```

Alternatively you can simply fork this repo and edit the script to your liking. Configuration is as simple as adding and removing applications from lists at the top of the script.
